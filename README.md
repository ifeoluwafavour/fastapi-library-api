# Library API with FastAPI

 A CRUD library API made with FastAPI used to illustrate how to code create, read, update and delete endpoints in FastAPI

 ## Prerequisites
 - Python (3.6+)
 - [FastAPI](fastapi.tiangolo.com) installed via pip

## What you can do
You can browse the code to see how everything went. You can also clone the repository to see how the API works. 

If you don't know about FastAPI, now is a good time to know about it. Here are the resources I've used so far:
- [FastAPI course by Eric Roby](https://www.udemy.com/course/fastapi-the-complete-course/)
