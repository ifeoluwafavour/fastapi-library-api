# Library API with FastAPI

 A CRUD library API made with FastAPI used to illustrate how to code create, read, update and delete endpoints in FastAPI

 ## Prerequisites
 The following are needed to recreate this project
 - Python (3.6+)
 - FastAPI
```
pip install fastapi
```
 - Uvicorn
```
pip install uvicorn[standard]
```

## Test the API
Follow these steps to test the API on your local machine
- Navigate to your preferred directory and clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ifeoluwafavour/fastapi-library-api
```
- Navigate to the library folder in the repository, create and activate a virtual environment
For Windows:
```
python -m venv myenv

myenv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
For Mac OS and Linux:
```
python -m venv myenv

source myenv/bin/activate
```
- Install FastAPI and uvicorn in the virtual environment
```
pip install fastapi

pip install uvicorn[standard]
```
- Run the server for the API. A localhost address will come up for you to test the API with
 ```
uvicorn books:app --reload
```
- Test the API with the Swagger UI docs that was automatically generated by adding `/docs` to the localhost address like so, `127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
